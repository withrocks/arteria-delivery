Making changes to the database model
--------------------------------------
Alembic is used to update the database, and migration scripts can be auto generated for most scenarios. However,
that means that when you need to make changes to the database models (i.e. all the models in
`delivery.models.db_models`) the you need to generate the revisions scripts. This can be done using the following
command:

    alembic -c config/alembic.ini revision --autogenerate -m '<your comment on what you changed>'
